# ‚úàÔ∏è TravelPal

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
TravelPal is a website for travelers! Input the country you're travelling to and it'll provide you with practical information you'll need for your trip! 

Created with pure HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, and the [travelbriefing.org API](https://travelbriefing.org/api).

### ‚ùì Why did I create it?
I have a strong desire to travel & experience the world, so I decided to work on a project related to it :)

I created this website in May 2021 with the goal of improving my front-end web development skills. Overall, a really fun project! It was my first time working with CSS grid, local storage, and APIs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tools:
- Weather charts were created using the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library
- The TravelPal logo was created using Adobe Illustrator
- Country flag icons were obtained from [here](https://flagpedia.net/download/api)
